# InvestigateGlobalInterGold

My notes on Global InterGold.

## Are there any signs that GIG is a MLM-based pyramid scheme?

List from [Bosley & McKeage, 2015]:

 * Little/no demonstrated company revenue from retail sales to public (sales to those outside the MLM program): Agree
 * Participant income primarily derived from recruitment rates than sales of products: Agree
 * Sales pitch emphasizes recruiting: Agree
 * Excessive earnings claims or promises of high returns in a short time period: Agree
 * Product is unproven and/or unfairly priced: Undescided, as I can agree ('The gold is not the product, so what *is*?') and disagree ('The gold has a fair price')
 * Buy-in required: Agree, costs 275 euro's
 * Vast majority of participants lose money: Unknown
 * No information of potential expenses (in writing): Unknown
 * Consumer complaints (from other regions or prioir waves): Agree
 * High turnover of past participants: Unknown
 * Exponential growth in participation: Unknown
 * Messages of easy money or passive income: Agree, passive money is earned from the Leadership Program
 * Complex commission structure: Agree, the tables are complex to understand in full detail, the Leadership Project plan is simpler
 * Required inventory purchases: Undecided, as I can agree ('Your money is automatically converted to gold'), and disagree ('Your money simply loses value when tranferring from GIG account to your bank')
 * Mandatory purchases (beyond want or need) to stay in good standing: Agree, there is social pressure for participants to keep filling tables
 * No clear refund policy (in writing): Disagree
 * Past legal action against the company: Agree
 * Rapid decline in participation: Unknown
 * Growth in participation despite recession: Unknown
 * High participation in economically depressed regions: Unknown

This brings the list to:

 * Agree: 10x
 * Disagree: 1x
 * Undescided: 2x
 * Unknown: 7x

For comparison, this is about the now-terminated MyClickWinners:

 * Agree: 7x
 * Disagree: 2x
 * Undescided: 3x
 * Unknown: 8x
